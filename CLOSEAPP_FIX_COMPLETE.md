# CloseApplication Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Identified
The CloseApplication RPC was using `wmctrl -c "title"` which is unreliable for closing windows by title.

## Solution Implemented
**3-Step Robust Approach:**

1. **List all windows**: `wmctrl -l` to get window IDs and titles
2. **Find matching window**: Search for window containing app name (case-insensitive)
3. **Close by ID**: Use `wmctrl -ic WINDOW_ID` to close immediately
4. **Fallback**: If no window found or wmctrl fails, use `pkill -f app_name`

## Testing Results
✅ Calculator closes successfully by window ID
✅ pkill fallback works when window not found
✅ Binary verified with new code
