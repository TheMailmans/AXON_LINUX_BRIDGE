## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUE: WINDOW FOCUS**

**Problem:** When terminal launches, it doesn't automatically get focus, so keystrokes go nowhere.

**Solution:** Mac agent needs to add window focus step after launching apps.

### **Quick Fix for Mac Agent:**

```python
# After LaunchApplication succeeds:
stub.LaunchApplication(app_name="terminal")
time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for window to appear

# OPTION 1: Use mouse click to focus (NOW FAST!)
# Click anywhere in the terminal window
stub.InjectMouseClick(x=700, y=400, button="left")
time.sleep(0.2)

# OPTION 2: Wait for FocusWindow RPC (Ubuntu agent to implement)
# stub.FocusWindow(window_class="gnome-terminal-server")

# Now type commands
stub.InjectKeyPress(key="l", modifiers=[])
stub.InjectKeyPress(key="s", modifiers=[])
stub.InjectKeyPress(key="Return", modifiers=[])
```

## 🧪 **TEST IT NOW!**

Your Mac agent can test the mouse click fix immediately:

```python
import time
import grpc
from your_proto import DesktopAgentStub

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('192.168.64.3:50051')
stub = DesktopAgentStub(channel)

# This should complete in <1 second now (was 10-15 seconds):
start = time.time()
response = stub.InjectMouseClick(x=500, y=500, button="left")
elapsed = time.time() - start

print(f"Mouse click completed in {elapsed:.2f}s")
# Expected: 0.05-0.15 seconds ✅
```

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **For Mac Agent (NOW):**
1. ✅ Update connection IP to `192.168.64.3` (not .4)
2. ✅ Test mouse click speed (should be <1 second)
3. ✅ Add mouse click after LaunchApplication to focus window
4. ✅ Test end-to-end: Launch terminal → click to focus → type "ls"

### **For Ubuntu Agent (30 minutes):**
1. ⏳ Implement FocusWindow RPC (see MAC_AGENT_REPORT.md Solution 2)
2. ⏳ Test with `xdotool search --class gnome-terminal-server windowactivate`
3. ⏳ Deploy and notify Mac agent
