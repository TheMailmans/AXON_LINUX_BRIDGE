Hi Bridge Team,

We've implemented new screenshot functionality with 3 fallback methods (scrot, gnome-screenshot, imagemagick) and need your help testing on Ubuntu.

**What you need to do**:
1. Pull latest code from main branch
2. Follow instructions in: `BRIDGE_TEAM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Complete test checklist: `UBUNTU_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
4. Report results (estimated 2-3 hours)

**Deadline**: [YOUR DEADLINE]
